# oculus rating data

things you can do with this:

- download all application data from oculus share

- import eVRydayVR's data from the attached CSV

- generate JSON which you can use to make pretty charts with flot (see
[twentymilliseconds.com][www] for examples)

There are some docs on [godoc][godoc].

### this is not a project I am going to commit to maintaining

I added this repo to satisfy an itch, and in the interest of reproducibility
for a post on Twenty Milliseconds.

- Do not expect prompt response to issues

- do not expect the library to be stable over time

- do not expect user-friendliness in the README

- do not expect an HTTP API where this json data will be exposed

If you would like any of these things, fork the project and send me a link.
